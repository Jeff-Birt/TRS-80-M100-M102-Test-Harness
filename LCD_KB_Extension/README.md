# TRS-80-M100 Keybaord and LCD Extension
This set of PCBs and cables allow you to connect the TRS-80 M100 LCD and 
keyboard so that you can use them while servicing the main board.

All the files are here so you can make your own. If you do make your own please do not remove attribtuion to the creator (me) or charge absurd prices on eBay.

You can buy a reasonably priced kit from me at: https://www.soigeneris.com
