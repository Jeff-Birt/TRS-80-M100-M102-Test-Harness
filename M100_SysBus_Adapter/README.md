# TRS-80-M100 System Bus Adapter
The TRS-80 M100 uses a 40-pin socket to allow external devices access to 
the system bus. The idea being that you use a 40-pin DIP IDC ribbon cable connector on one end and a 40-pin female IDC ribbon cable connector on the other.

The 40-pin DIP IDC ribbon cable connectors can be hard to find and hard to properly crimp. As an alterntive I made this adapter which provides a stadard 30-pin male boxed header. You can use then make a simple ribbon calbe with standard 40-pin female IDC ribbon cable connectors on both ends. 

The device end of the ribbon cable will now have the same pinout as the System Bus connector on the back of the TRS-80 Model 102.

All the files are here so you can make your own. If you do make your own please do not remove attribtuion to the creator (me) or charge absurd prices on eBay.
